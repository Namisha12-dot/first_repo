The environment refers to the natural world that surrounds usâ€”the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land on which we live, and the ecosystems that exist in balance to support life. It includes everything from forests and oceans to wildlife and plant species, all of which interact to form a delicate web of life. Our environment sustains us, providing resources like food, energy, and clean air, but the delicate balance that sustains life is increasingly under threat due to human activities.

Over the years, environmental degradation has become one of the most pressing global concerns. Deforestation, pollution, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and overexploitation of natural resources are all significant challenges that our planet faces. Human development has often come at the expense of the environment. For example, industrial activities emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming and climate change. Similarly, deforestation for agriculture and urbanization destroys habitats and reduces biodiversity, leading to the extinction of species.
